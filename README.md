# multi-select
Pure multi select widget not requiring any framework or library

This multi select widget creates a widget that allows the user to select multiple options from a dropdown list. The widget consists of a button that, when clicked, opens a list of options. Each option can be clicked to toggle it as selected or unselected. If an option has sub items, clicking on it will also select or unselect all child options. The number of selected options is displayed on the button.

This widget can be useful for forms or other user interface elements where the user needs to select multiple items from a list.
